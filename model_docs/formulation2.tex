\subsubsection{Global Temperature Dependence}
The inadequacy portion of the model is contained in a linear part $\Sop$ and a nonlinear part 
$\rrc$ which are both temperature independent.  Temperature dependence is built in through 
a prefator $g\lr{T}$.  
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\x}{t} &= \rr + g\lr{T}\left[\Sop \x + \rrc\right] \\
  \odeone{T}{t}  &= \frac{-\displaystyle \h\lr{T}\cdot\odeone{\x}{t} + \dot{\mathcal{Q}}}{\displaystyle \cp\lr{T}\cdot\x}.
\end{align}
Two forms for the prefactor are the Arrhenius form and the hyperbolic tangent switch. 
The Arrhenius form is
\begin{align}
  g_{A}\lr{T} = \exp\lr{-T_{ag} / T}
\end{align}
where $T_{ag}$ is the global activation temperature.  The global hyperbolic switch has 
the form
\begin{align}
  g_{S}\lr{T} = \tanh\lr{T-T_{ig}} = \tanh\lr{T - T_{adg}}
\end{align}
where $T_{ig}$ and $T_{adg}$ are the global ignition temperature and the global 
adiabatic flame temperature.
