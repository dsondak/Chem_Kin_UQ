\section{Inadequacy Formulations}
Equations~\eqref{eq:reduced} and~\eqref{eq:reduced_T} are not always sufficient to represent 
chemical reactions with the fidelity needed in combustion applications.  We introduce an 
additional term to the reduced model to capture the effects of the neglected reactions and 
species.  The general form is 
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\xs}{t} &= \rrr\lr{\xr, T} + \rrs\lr{\xr, T; \pars}
\end{align}
and we wish to develop a reasonable form for $\rrs\lr{\xr, T; \pars}$.  Note that $\pars$ 
represents stochastic parameters that enter into the model.
