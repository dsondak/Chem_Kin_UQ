This directory hinges around the program 
calc_rhs.c.  The goal of the program is to 
compute RHS functions using the RHS from 
the reduced model.

It reads in a solution from the detailed 
or reduced model (specified by the user)
and uses Antioch to compute the RHS at each 
time step using the reaction scheme from 
the reduced model.

The results are saved in ``reduced_rhs.h5'' 
or ``detailed_rhs.h5'' depending on the 
model that was run.

If the user wants to change parameters then 
they need to do so in the main function 
under INPUT PARAMETERS and then recompile. 
This should be in an input file but it's 
not yet.
