\section{Governing Equations}
A detailed chemical mechanism consists of a set of $\nrd$ reactions involving $\nsd$ species.  
Let $\xd = \left[x_{1}^{D}, \ldots, x_{\nsd}^{D}\right]^{\dagger} \in \mathbb{R}^{\nsd}$ denote 
a vector of species in the detailed model.  Then a set of coupled ODEs governing the evolution 
of each species and temperature is
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\xd}{t} &= \rrd \\
  \odeone{T}{t}   &= \frac{\displaystyle -\hd\lr{T}\cdot\odeone{\xd}{t} + \dot{\mathcal{Q}}}{\displaystyle \cpd\lr{T}\cdot\xd}
\end{align}
where $\dot{\mathcal{Q}}$ is a heating rate and $\cpd\lr{T}$ is the specific heat at constant 
pressure.  Note that
\begin{align}
  \cpd\lr{T} = \left.\pdeone{\hd}{T}\right|_{p}
\end{align}
where $\hd$ is the enthalpy of the detailed model.  In general, we denote the enthalpy by $h$ 
and the specific heat at constant pressure by $c_{p}$.
Two other useful relations are
\begin{align}
  h\lr{T} &= \int{c_{p}\lr{T} \ \mathrm{d}T} \label{eq:h_cp_rel} \\
  s\lr{T} &= \int{\frac{c_{p}}{T} \ \mathrm{d}T} \label{eq:s_cp_rel}
\end{align}
where $s\lr{T}$ is the entropy.

In actual combustion simulations, we wish to reduce the size of the chemical kinetics system.  
To this end, let $\xr = \left[x_{1}^{R}, \ldots, x_{\nsr}^{R}\right]^{\dagger} \in \mathbb{R}^{\nsr}$ 
denote a vector of species in the reduced model.  Note that $\nsr < \nsd$.  Then, the reduced 
system of equations becomes,
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\xr}{t} &= \rrr \label{eq:reduced}\\
  \odeone{T}{t}   &= \frac{\displaystyle -\hr\lr{T}\cdot\odeone{\xr}{t} + \dot{\mathcal{Q}}}{\displaystyle \cpr\lr{T}\cdot\xr}. \label{eq:reduced_T}
\end{align}

Note that we can introduce a transition matrix, $\B = \left[\beta_{ij}\right]$, that 
redistributes neglected species from the detailed model to the reduced model.  That is
\begin{align}
  x_{i}^{R} = \sum_{j=\nsr + 1}^{\nsd}{\beta_{ij}x_{j}^{D}}. \label{eq:transition}
\end{align}
We will use this matrix in subsequent sections.
