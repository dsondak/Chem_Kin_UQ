This version of the kinetics solver does not solve for the temperature field 
from an energy equation.  The temperature profile is read in from the 
detailed model and passed to the RHS function along with all the other user 
data.  The value of the temperature at a given internal CVODE iteration is 
linearly interpolated from the temperature data given the internal CVODE 
time.

Must have detailed_data.h5 in this directory.  The temperature profile will 
be read in from that file.
