\section{Inadequacy Formulations}
Equations~\eqref{eq:reduced} and~\eqref{eq:reduced_T} are not always sufficient to represent 
chemical reactions with the fidelity needed in combustion applications.  We introduce an 
additional term to the reduced model to capture the effects of the neglected reactions and 
species.  The general form is 
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\xs}{t} &= \rrr\lr{\xr, T} + \rrs\lr{\xr, T; \pars}
\end{align}
and we wish to develop a reasonable form for $\rrs\lr{\xr, T; \pars}$.  Note that $\pars$ 
represents stochastic parameters that enter into the model.

\subsection{Initial Formulation}
This initial formulation is due to Rebecca's thesis work.  We augment the species in the 
reduced model by $\na$ ``catchall'' species which are intended to mimic the effect of the 
species that were neglected in going from the detailed to the reduced model.  Catchall 
species and their quantities are denoted with a supersript $\prime$.  The species 
concentrations are now given by 
$\x = \left[x_{1}, \ldots, \x_{\nsr}, \x_{\nsr+1}, \ldots, \x_{\nsr + \na}\right]^{\dagger}$ 
where $\na$ is the number of atoms in the system.  The enthalpies are augmented similarly.  
We therefore introduce an enhanced reduced model of the form,
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\x}{t} &= \rr + \left[\Sop \x + \rrc\right] \label{eq:inad_reb} \\
  \odeone{T}{t}  &= \frac{-\displaystyle \h\lr{T}\cdot\odeone{\x}{t} + \dot{\mathcal{Q}}}
                         {\displaystyle \cp\lr{T}\cdot\x}. \label{eq:energy_reb}
\end{align}
The operators $\Sop$ and $\rrc$ are stochastic in nature and have several parameters that 
must be calibrated.  We must also specify a form for the enthalpies of the ``catchall'' 
species.  This was done by assuming a simple linear temperature dependence of the specific 
heat on the temperature.  In general,  
\begin{align}
  \hic{k} = \sum_{i=0}^{p}{\alpha_{ki}T^{i}}
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
  \cpic{k} = \sum_{i=1}^{p}{i\alpha_{ki}T^{i-1}}
\end{align}
where $p-1$ is the polynomial order being used to represent the specific heat.  Note that 
using~\eqref{eq:s_cp_rel} we have the additional relationship 
\begin{align}
  \sic{k} = \gamma_{k0} + \alpha_{k1}\ln\lr{T} + \sum_{i=2}^{p}{\frac{i}{i-1}\alpha_{ki}T^{i-1}}.
\end{align}
When $p=2$ we have simply 
\begin{align}
  \hic{k}  &= \alpha_{k0} + \alpha_{k1}T + \alpha_{k2}T^{2} \\ 
  \cpic{k} &= \alpha_{k1} + 2\alpha_{k2}T \\
  \sic{k}  &= \gamma_{k0}  + \alpha_{k1}\ln\lr{T} + 2\alpha_{k2}T.
\end{align}



\subsubsection{Global Temperature Dependence}
The inadequacy portion of the model is contained in a linear part $\Sop$ and a nonlinear part 
$\rrc$ which are both temperature independent.  Temperature dependence is built in through 
a prefator $g\lr{T}$.  
\begin{align}
  \odeone{\x}{t} &= \rr + g\lr{T}\left[\Sop \x + \rrc\right] \\
  \odeone{T}{t}  &= \frac{-\displaystyle \h\lr{T}\cdot\odeone{\x}{t} + \dot{\mathcal{Q}}}{\displaystyle \cp\lr{T}\cdot\x}.
\end{align}
Two forms for the prefactor are the Arrhenius form and the hyperbolic tangent switch. 
The Arrhenius form is
\begin{align}
  g_{A}\lr{T} = \exp\lr{-T_{ag} / T}
\end{align}
where $T_{ag}$ is the global activation temperature.  The global hyperbolic switch has 
the form
\begin{align}
  g_{S}\lr{T} = \tanh\lr{T-T_{ig}} = \tanh\lr{T - T_{adg}}
\end{align}
where $T_{ig}$ and $T_{adg}$ are the global ignition temperature and the global 
adiabatic flame temperature.

\subsection{Dissociation-Recombination Reactions}
The linear part of the original inadequacy formulation~\ref{eq:inad_reb} is very 
high-dimensional.  We would like to reduce the dimensionality of the inadequacy 
formulation.  This will provide some additional flexibility when introducing a 
temperature dependence (e.g. we may be able to get with something more fine-grained 
than a global temperature dependence).

As a first step, we can introduce a set of reversible dissociation-recombination 
(D-R) reactions.  These reactions will allow species to dissociate into elemental 
catchall species.  For example, the \ce{H2}-\ce{O2} system consists of the set 
of species $\left\{\ce{H}, \ce{O}, \ce{H2}, \ce{O2}, \ce{OH}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{HO2}\right\}$. 
The set of catchall species is $\left\{\ce{H}^{\prime}, \ce{O}^{\prime}\right\}$. 
An example of a D-R reaction would be 
\begin{align}
  \ce{H2O <=> 2H^{\prime} + O^{\prime}}.
\end{align} 
We would then form the ODE system as usual and include this new reaction.  We 
would of course also need to provide a form for the enthalpy and a form for 
entropy for the catchall species since we are now dealing with a reversible 
reaction.
