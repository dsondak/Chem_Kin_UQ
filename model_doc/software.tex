\section{Software}

\subsection{Goal}
The aim of this software is to simulate the perfectly stirred 
reactor (forward problem) for various right-hand-sides and to 
perform uncertainty quantification tasks for different 
inadequacy operators.  It can also be used in conjunction with 
tasks for control and design under uncertainty.

\subsection{Dependencies}
The following dependencies are required to run the perfectly-
stirred reactor,
\begin{itemize}
  \item GSL     (2.0)
  \item Antioch (0.5.0) 
  \item Eigen (3.2.6)
  \item GRVY (0.32.0)
  \item HDF5 (1.8.15).
\end{itemize}
A working \texttt{GNU} compiler is required.  \texttt{gcc/5.2} 
has been used successfully to build the perfectly-stirred 
reactor.
